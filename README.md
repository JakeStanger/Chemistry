#Chemistry In Minecraft
This mod strives to add as much chemistry as it can to Minecraft. It's currently very early in development, so don't expect anything yet.
The idea of this mod is to add a base, with all of the elements and the ability to produce any compound, along with a few very basic machines. Modders will be able to use this base to build their own extensions.
